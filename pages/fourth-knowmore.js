                <p>
                  Businesses are constantly driven by their inherent instincts
                  to survive&#44; grow&#44; sustain and flourish. The concept of
                  an enterprise operating as a living&#44; breathing organism
                  has been explored for several decades now. Many organizations
                  aren&apos;t experiencing the full value that technology can
                  deliver. This short playbook by OMRA Solutions introduces you
                  to the “Why” and How of a modern IT operating model to
                  overcome barriers to delivering optimized outputs from your IT
                  infrastructure. With technology driving transformation&#44;
                  the long-term sustainable value will only be created by
                  unifying business and technology strategies to create
                  exponential value for companies.

                <h3>THE IMPERATIVE FOR CHANGE</h3>
                <p>
                  As the pace&#44; scale&#44; and impact of technological
                  innovation and disruption have exponentially escalated&#44;
                  technology has become a primary influence on business
                  strategy&#44; strategic choices&#44; and value creation
                  models. Five technology driven forces add to the already
                  complex range of decisions facing the C suite and other
                  business leaders:
                </p>
                <ul className="bullets space-section">

                    Identify alternative technology models and solutions that
                    address key risks• Convergence &#45; The fusion of physical
                    and digital worlds has blurred industry boundaries&#44;
                    tangled value chains&#44; and disrupted traditional value
                    creation models
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Data proliferation &#45; Mountains of data and applied
                    intelligence can inform decisions that allow businesses to
                    adapt and remain ahead of disruption.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Competing horizons &#45; C suite leaders often must
                    simultaneously manage today&apos;s business while building
                    the company of the future. Strategic choices made today have
                    long-lasting implications and should be made in the context
                    of a broader and fast moving ecosystem.

                  <li>
                    Customer empowerment. Technology has created rapidly
                    evolving norms for engaging customers&#44; triggering
                    turnover and fragmentation in customer experience.

                  <li>
                    Speed and volatility &#45; The cloud and other technologies
                    have lowered barriers to entry&#44; allowing new business
                    models to be developed and launched in weeks and drastically
                    reducing the shelf life of both competitive advantages and
                    existing business models.

                  The global pandemic has had a tremendous impact on the global
                  and Indian technology services industry. There are several
                  immediate shifts as well as global mega-trends that offer new
                  opportunities and challenges which need to be thought of now.
                  New delivery models&#44; the workforce of the future&#44; and
                  the digital&#44; consumer&#44; and emerging ecosystems are
                  themes that will affect the industry in a big way. Companies
                  need to develop a twopart response to the evolving landscape
                  the near term plan of action and long-term strategic
                  rethinking.

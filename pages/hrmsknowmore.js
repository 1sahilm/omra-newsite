                  Time attendance is a basic HR process affecting everyone and
                  critical as a basic input to the payroll process. HR faces
                  problems of integrating attendance inputs from different
                  attendance logging systems e.g. Cards&#44; biometric scanners
                  and manual attendance register across all business locations.
                  Each month a lot of HR time is spent collecting and
                  reconciling attendance data before payroll can be correctly
                  processed. Attendance software gives you the ability to
                  collect data from multiple sources and track your employees
                  time and attendance automatically as per the company rules and
                  policies. Attendance software communicates with attendance
                  devices to fetch employee punches from the device and
                  calculate daily attendance based on a daily basis or work hour
                  basis. It also calculates total work time&#44; overtime&#44;
                  late in&#44; early out for each employee in accordance with
                  the rules that apply to an employee or a group of employees.

                Reconciling employee attendance is a very crucial task for each
                HR manager and involves a lot of expensive time. Defining leave
                rules is not just where it ends&#44; but managing leaves and
                updating employee leaves on a regular basis to keep the payroll
                accurate is a very tedious and time consuming task. Our team has
                put in a very considerable effort to create&#44; manage and
                track employee leave by creating a new module for OMRA
                Solutions. This Leave management module simplifies the complex
                task of monthly reconciliation of leaves of each employee and
                allows the managers and HR admin to handle employee leave
                efficiently and systematically maintaining the flexibility.
              </p>
              <p className="paragraph-box">
                A Significant amount of expensive employee&#44; manager and HR
                time is wasted in a very basic HR process. To handle this we
                have seamlessly integrated the leave management with an employee
                selfservice portal that allows employees to apply for leaves
                &#47; submit a leave request which goes to the immediate
                reporting head. Employees can also view their leave balances and
                track their leaves for each month using the employee self
                service portal. This tool&#44; leave management with employee
                self service portal considerably reduces the load on HR and
                simplifies the cumbersome task of managing the employee
                attendance and leave for a month to month basis. Define leave
                types or create new leave types based on our company&apos;s
                timeoff policy. We color code each leave type&#44; enable IP
                restrictions and customize based&#44; on location&#44;
                roles&#44; employees&#44; gender&#44; marital status&#44;
                etc.&#44; you can also configure the list of holidays based on
                location and other influencing factors. This eliminates
                confusion and potential conflicts. The Human Resource Management
                System HRMS is a set of tools designed to automate and manage
                recruiting and staffing operations at OMRA Solutions. By posting

            <p className="paragraph-box">
              The function of the human resources department involves
              tracking&#44; employee histories&#44; skills&#44; abilities&#44;
              salaries&#44; and accomplishments. Replacing certain processes
              with various levels of HRMS systems can distribute information
              management responsibilities so that the bulk of information
              gathering is not delegated strictly to HR. By allowing employees
              to update personal information and perform other tasks&#44;
              information is kept more accurate and HR professionals are not
              bogged down. Each module performs a separate function within the
              HRMS that helps with information gathering or tracking. For
              example&#44; hiring would be carried out through the recruitment
              and on boarding module&#44; employee performance is carried out
              through the performance evaluation and management module&#44; and
              so on.
